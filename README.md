Submitted by: Ditry D'ateian

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

  * App allows the user to connect to digital wallets to split a bill between friends.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Working with the storyboard setting proved to be a bit challenging, mainly because
it is very simple and you loose a lot of the control you would get if you were programing
the interface manualy.
